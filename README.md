This app is ready to be deployed in Heroku:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

The app is ment to be used as a scheduled job (https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/scheduler): the web server does anything other then redirecting to this repository for instructions.

Install the *Heroku Scheduler* add-on and configure a new job:

**If you want notifications after a run, you need to implement your own bin's job (see the *doAll* callback)**
